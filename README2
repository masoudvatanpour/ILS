Steps for running the Optimization on the floorplan.png file:
	1) put desired floorplan.png file inside the optimization folder, 
	2) $ php convertFloorplan.php
	3) $ php produceActivityScript.php n form 	//... where "n" is the number of goals and "form" is the mobility model (uniform, ...)
	4) $ php produceTrace.php activityScript.txt      //... where "activityScript.txt" is the name of the activity file produced in step 3
	5) $ php produceHeatmap.php form      //... where form is the mobility model (uniform, ...)
	valla
